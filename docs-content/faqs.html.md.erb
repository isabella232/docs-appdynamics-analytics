## <a id='AAFAQS'></a> Transactional Analytics Agent FAQs

### <a id='t1'></a> How do I configure Analytics Agent?

Please refer these [Configuration instructions](https://docs.pivotal.io/partners/appdynamics-analytics/installing.html)

### <a id='t2'></a> How is Analytics Agent Packaged?

We package `Standalone Analytics Agent` into tile. When the tile is installed it runs as java application on the 
elastic runtime of the PCF cloud.

### <a id='t3'></a> What analytics are supported?

Only transactional analytics are supported as of now. 

### <a id='t4'></a> How do I enable transactional anaytics for an application?

  * Install the tile, this deploys the analytics agent on the elastic runtime of the PCF cloud
  * The analytics agent listens on a URL, note down the url. 
  * For the application we want the transactional analytics set the environment variable `JAVA_OPTS: "-Dappdynamics.analytics.agent.url=http://<analytics-url>/v1/sinks/bt" ` 
  * Restage the application. 

### <a id='t5'></a> What needs to be done to enable SSL communication between applications and AppDynamics Analytics Service/Controller?
  * No additional configuration is required
  * Analytics agent container uses certificates imported into containers automatically by the BOSH director just like any other Java application container 
  * A key store is automatically created and managed by the standard java buildpack which analytics agent container is built of
  * The certficate issued by BOSH director is present in /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt

### <a id='t6'></a> How do we troubleshoot? 
  * Check the logs 
  * Check for any errors

<pre class="terminal">
  $  cf ssh appdanalytics-{version} -c "cat /home/vcap/app/analytics-agent/logs/analytics-agent.log"
</pre>

<pre class="terminal">
  $ cf ssh appdanalytics-{version} -c "cat /home/vcap/app/analytics-agent/logs/analytics-agent-http.log"
</pre>

### <a id='t7'></a> There are SSL errors in the logs? How do we check the certificate
  * This certificate is automatically generated and imported into container by PCF OpsManager Security Manager
  * If you are using an OnPrem Controller with SSL installation. Make sure you have included the entire certificate chain in the security config of the OpsManager director tile
  * To verify if the certificate is properly imported.  Check the certficate chain `/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt` in the container and verify if the relevant certficate is present in the chain

<pre class="terminal">
  $  cf ssh appdanalytics-{version} -c "cat /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt"
</pre>


### <a id='t8'></a> How is the Keystore created from the crt file?
  * We use the standard java buildpack to create the analytics agent container. 
  * As for any java container, the buildpack automatically creates the TrustManager for `/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt` and watches it. 

<pre class="terminal">
  $  cf ssh appdanalytics-{version} -c "grep -i TrustManager ~/app/analytics-agent/logs/*.log"
