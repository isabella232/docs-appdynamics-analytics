<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> This tile is planned to be deprecated. We suggest using agentless analytics, which does not 
    need an Appdynamics Analytics Agent installed via the AppDynamics Analytics tile.  See <a href="https://docs.appdynamics.com/display/PRO45/Deploy+Analytics+Without+the+Analytics+Agent">Deploying Analytics without the Analytics agent</a> for further details</p>


## <a id='overview'></a> Overview

The AppDynamics Application Analytics for VMware Tanzu tile supports collecting
[Transaction Analytics](https://docs.appdynamics.com/display/LATEST/Application+Analytics)
in real-time from VMware Tanzu apps to connect application performance, user experience, and business outcomes.
It deploys an analytics agent in the VMware Tanzu environment that will forward transaction analytics events
from VMware Tanzu apps to an AppDynamics Events Service.
