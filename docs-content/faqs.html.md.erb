## <a id='AAFAQS'></a> Application Analytics Agent FAQs

### <a id='t1'></a> How do I configure an Application Analytics Agent?

Please refer these [Configuration instructions](https://docs.pivotal.io/partners/appdynamics-analytics/installing.html)

### <a id='t2'></a> How is Analytics Agent Packaged?

We package an `Analytics Agent` into a tile. When the tile is installed it runs as a Java application on the elastic runtime of the PCF cloud.

### <a id='t3'></a> What Application Analytics modules are supported?

Currently only Transaction Analytics are supported.

### <a id='t4'></a> How do I enable Application Analytics for an application?

  * Installing the tile deploys an analytics agent on the elastic runtime of the PCF cloud.
  * This analytics agent listens on a URL, note down the url.
  * For the application to capture transaction analytics set the environment variable `JAVA_OPTS: "-Dappdynamics.analytics.agent.url=http://<analytics-url>/v1/sinks/bt"`
  * Restage the application. To learn more see: [Analytics Deployment Options](https://docs.appdynamics.com/display/PRO45/Analytics+Deployment+Options)

### <a id='t5'></a> What needs to be done to enable SSL communication between applications and AppDynamics Analytics Service/Controller?
  * No additional configuration is required.
  * The analytics agent container uses certificates imported into containers automatically by the BOSH director just like any other Java application container
  * A key store is automatically created and managed by the standard java buildpack which creates the analytics agent container
  * The certficate issued by BOSH director is present in `/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt`

### <a id='t6'></a> How to troubleshoot Application Analytics for PCF?
  * Check the Analytics Agent container logs
  * Check for any errors

<pre class="terminal">
  $  cf ssh appdanalytics-{version} -c "cat /home/vcap/app/analytics-agent/logs/analytics-agent.log"
</pre>

<pre class="terminal">
  $ cf ssh appdanalytics-{version} -c "cat /home/vcap/app/analytics-agent/logs/analytics-agent-http.log"
</pre>

### <a id='t7'></a> There are SSL errors in the logs? How do we check the certificate?
  * This certificate is automatically generated and imported into a container by PCF's OpsManager Security Manager.
  * If you are using an On-Premises Controller with SSL installation. Make sure you have included the entire certificate chain in the security configuration of the OpsManager director tile.
  * To verify if the certificate is properly imported, check the certficate chain `/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt` in the container and confirm that the relevant certficate is present in the chain.

<pre class="terminal">
  $  cf ssh appdanalytics-{version} -c "cat /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt"
</pre>


### <a id='t8'></a> How is the Keystore created from the .crt file?
  * We use the standard java buildpack to create the analytics agent container.
  * As for any java container, the buildpack automatically creates the TrustManager for `/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt` and watches it.

<pre class="terminal">
  $  cf ssh appdanalytics-{version} -c "grep -i TrustManager ~/app/analytics-agent/logs/*.log"
